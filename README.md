# Kinematics-of-Mobile-Robot
Kinematics is the most basic study of how mechanical systems behave. In mobile robotics, we need to understand the mechanical behavior of robots both in order to design appropriate mobile robots for tasks and to understand how to create control software for an instance of mobile robot hardware. In this task, you will derive the inverse kinematic model of a four-wheeled omnidirectional robot shown in Figure 1, design a position controller and test it on the provided virtual experiments. The task requires v-rep (for visualization) and Matlab (coding) tools.
